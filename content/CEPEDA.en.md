The WBA is operating
​with​ the indigenous community in environmental management, assisting technically with preservation, elimination of ectopic cultivars to the region, namely, removing any plantation commercial reforestation, as well as crops that will somehow hurt the quality of the soil and the native environment.

This partnership aspires to increase the demarcation to the natives with the consideration of the protection of borders, preventing deforestation, invasions, repaying fauna and stabilizing the flora in order to give the silvicula to your real function within society and your greatest contribution to protection and restoration of the environment.

This participation of the WBA is linked to satellite monitoring expertise, using your project mentor Sady Ricardo dos Santos Filho, mapping all the demarcated areas, selecting and identifying native plants by selecting and identifying cultivars Ectopic, planning the action of withdrawal of these cultivars, as soy plantations, pastures, pinus, eucalyptus, etc. Giving a target them and reverting the possible profit in financing the indigenous group itself, aparelhando and enabling the execution of the projects.

The team for the implementation and orientation of these projects, with vast experience in the Amazon, will extend this knowledge to every region of Brazil, taking advantage of the leaders of more than a hundred Brazilian indigenous Nations, creating training by schools themselves for the function that they fit.
