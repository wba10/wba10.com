Brazilian company founded in 2007, with it's main focused on environmental projects.
Operating inside Brazil and the Gulf Region with its target clients being governmental and private sector.
Like in our city Curitiba:


The city of Curitiba, in southern Brazil, is famous among urban planners for its innovation and rational development, with a reputation for being livable and very sustainable.  It was one of the first cities to market itself as “green” in a 1980s advertising campaign.
​Our director Sady Ricardo dos Santos Neto, supported by his father, while Deputy Mayor of Curitiba, approved the first waste sorting project, which involved separating organic from non-organic and hospital waste as well.​  
Curitiba is blessed with around 400 square kilometers of public parks or forest space. That is more than 50 square meters per inhabitant.  According to some measures, it emits 25 percent less carbon per capita than most Brazilian cities, even though more people own cars here.
Curitiba has also spearheaded programs that encourage residents to keep their streets clean and recycle, by offering them food in exchange for their waste. Still, the city landfill is expected to overflow this year and it is no longer the Brazilian city with the greenest space. Therefore, despite the success of aggressive urban planning measures undertaken forty years ago, Curitiba must continue to update its initiatives and adapt to the times.
Many Brazilians were attracted to Curitiba by the city's reputation as a functional, humane city and as a consequence its population has grown from 350,000 in the 1960s, when aggressive planning began, to 1.7 million today, with more than 3 million in the greater metropolitan area.
Curitiba, just like the rest of the world, is going through changes, and now it is the time to recycle effectively, recycling waste into energy.
The city found a solution for it, establishing a consortium between Curitiba and the metropolitan area cities.

During the 20th century, the human population increased rapidly, and cultural advances have been numerous. In this evolution, we have developed a consumer society, in which mass production has resulted in mass consumption, then in mass wastage.

As this tendency is becoming more and more pronounced, we began to realize the limitations of the Earth’s environmental capacity and resources.
If we can adjust the consumer cycle so that what is expelled as waste today can be reused in production, we can convert the world’s mountains of waste into mountains of resources.
The challenge to turn each bit of waste into resources has been started. Through this process, we aim to restore the environment’s vitality by putting abundant new recycled resources in our hands.

 **WASTE / REFUSE PROCESSING**

After crushing such bulky noncombustible objects such as household electronics, as well as wooden furniture, the waste is sorted into various categories, including steel, aluminum, combustible and noncombustible.
After sorting, steel, aluminum and other reusable resources are recycled (material recycling), while combustible waste is utilized as fuel.
Shredder, Pre-Shredder
This machine uses two functions, impact and shearing, to crush large pieces of metal and other waste.
Disc Screen
The disc screen separates material particles by allowing the smaller fractions to drop through openings of controlled size. Unlike static screens, however, the disc screen continuously moves material across a series of rotating multiple toothed discs. Small particles are shaken loose, larger matter is moved on. The discs and the opening between them can be set to screen out glass, grit and ceramic material, aluminum and large fibrous matter. The high efficiency, compact design and minimum power requirements of the disc screen are ideal for resource recovery.
Magnetic Separator
This machine magnetically separates steel from other waste.
Rotary Screen
After magnetic waste has been sorted out, this machine separates crushed waste by size and sorts out combustible (which mixed with aluminum) from noncombustible waste.



**Automatic Bottle Sorting System**

Automatic bottle sorting system comprises sizing machine, aligning machine, color identification machine and clearing machine. A sizing  machine divides glass bottles into large or small categories, each bottle is aligned by an aligning machine before being sent via the conveyor to a color identification machine, which sorts the bottles by color and shape. Based on the data obtained from these machines, the clearing machine uses air and sweep the bottles into cullet hoppers prepared separately for each color.

Waste Plastic Material Separation System – Multi Sorter
The plastic differentiation sensor uses a contactless near-infrared ray reflection and absorption analysis system.  Waste plastics are categorized as polyvinyl chloride and other types. This system can be applied to remove PVC from other plastics destined for RDF production.

Air Density Separator (ADS)
      The air density separator uses a vacuum system to separate rocks, knots, and other high density materials from a flow of lighter material.  Air is pulled through an adjustable separation zone where the lighter fraction is pulled upwards to a cyclone material separator. The light fraction in the cyclone is separated from the air and drops through a rotary airlock to be discharged as “accepts” for fuel.  The reject fractions consisting of higher density materials are discharged from the separation chamber for further processing.




ETA/ETE/ATI
It is a highly efficient Dissolution Air Flotation (DAF) unit, open surface, provided with a circular tank. The Delta purge presents a two-step process, Dissolution Air flocculation and flotation, gathered into one.
The floating and sediment sludge is transported by a fisherman paddle or spiral, situated on a bridge that turns the tank. Bottom scrapers remove any sediment, leading it to the collector of sediment, which is drained at regular intervals. Along with side scrapers, they keep the machine completely clean.
