Musa Agro Química Ltda.
 
Family company established in 1967 by Sady Ricardo dos Santos Filho and Muna Karam dos Santos.

Dr. Sady Ricardo dos Santos Filho, Agronomist, official of the Ministry of Agriculture having 4 kids at that time, huge field experience in the interior  cities of Paraná and Santa Catarina, deeply knowledgeable of the land  needs,  the climatic variables, atmospheric pressure and humidity.
Due to the difficulties of keeping a big family with a regular salary as a government employee he created a product, an herbicide, which would be sold to municipalities and ports in order to get rid of the grass that grew among the pavement stones. This product, called ”Fitotox”, was a great success in sales generating good resources for the company and for his family. After a while, the company entered the automotive business creating products such as car and motorcycle wax, furniture polish, tire shine spray and a cleaning product made of wax and liquid soap for gas station car washes.
The car wax had a unique, amazing feature; it could be used with the car wet and made the vehicle waterproof for weeks because of the characteristics of the formula which merged pure carnauba wax from Bahia - Brazil, added to petroleum products, combining cleaning, waterproofing and brightness to the magic formula. Those were long years of marketing and competition with large multinationals.
The mentor and manager Sady Ricardo dos Santos Filho, in the Ministry of agriculture, became general manager of sanitary and vigilance service of Paraná and later on became President of Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa (Agriculture Research Center of Brazil).
Due to all these responsibilities, he delegated the company management to his sons and went on to dedicate himself to projects related to the environment, which later would internalize into our company, in addition to the marketing of the products mentioned above.




After that, in charge of his positions, he started to work with environmental projects, including the Satellite Center of Research to provide an adequate planting.

He created the project and guided the first Brazilian waste management and sorting projects presented by his son to the city of Curitiba, teaching people to recycle and reuse oil containers. It is not possible to talk about the company's history without talking about the history of its CEO. Over the years, he has been working with contemporary guidelines, creating and directing us to form an innovative, ethic company and with the mission of providing an eco-friendly and sustainable world, using natural means, and thus not disturbing the ability of the planet as a healthy and living organism.
