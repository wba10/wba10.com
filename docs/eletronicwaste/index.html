<p>E-waste is growing, and with that surge comes the need for effective electronics recycling programs.People are urgently looking for information on TV recycling, computer recycling, and other programs that will help them responsibly get rid of unwanted equipment â€‹while minimizing any risk of information or identity theft.</p>

<p>With new cheap devices, society has reaped tremendous benefits. This explosive growth in the electronics industry, however, has led to a rapidly escalating issue of end-of-life (EOL) electronics or e-waste.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-e-waste">What Is E-Waste</h3>

<p>These EOL electronic devices, also known as e-waste and e-scrap, includes such items as dated computer equipment, stereos, televisions and mobile phones. Such items can often be refurbished or recycled, yet a large amount still finds its way to the landfill. Current Low Recycling Rates Combined with the rapid growth, recent recycling rates are still inadequate.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-electronics-recycling-important">Why Is Electronics Recycling Important?</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Rich Source of Raw Materials Internationally, only 10-15 percent of the gold in e-waste is successfully recovered while the rest is lost. Ironically, electronic waste contains deposits of precious metal estimated to be between 40 and 50 times richer than ores mined from the earth, according to the United Nations.</p></li>

<li><p>Solid Waste Management Because the explosion of growth in the electronics industry, combined with short product life cycle has led to a rapid escalation in the generation of solid waste.</p></li>

<li><p>Toxic Materials Because old electronic devices contain toxic substances such as lead, mercury, cadmium and chromium, proper processing is essential to ensure that these materials are not released into the environment. They may also contain other heavy metals and potentially toxic chemical flame retardants.</p></li>

<li><p>International Movement of Hazardous Waste The uncontrolled movement of e-waste to countries where cheap labor and primitive approaches to recycling have resulted in health risks to local residents exposed to the release of toxins continues to an issue of concern.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="regulation-for-electronic-waste-treatment">Regulation for Electronic Waste Treatment</h3>

<p>In 2010, the National Solid Waste Policy, or PNRS, was published, regulating the proper treatment for waste in general. Although it does not specify a directive for electronic waste, most of it can be applied to this type of material. Brazil is one of the few countries in Latin America that has regulations that somehow are applied to electronic waste treatment.</p>

<p>The PNRS states that every institution and organization is responsible for separating and properly dumping the waste they produce, which includes industry, commerce, cities and consumers. Following this premise, companies are investing in reverse logistic operations in order to collect their products at the end of its life cycle. Consumers must participate in this process, separating the waste and taking it to proper delivery posts.</p>

<p>The PNRS categorized electro-electronics and fluorescent lamps as special solid waste, which the producers are obligated to collect due to the high environmental impact it may cause.</p>
