			<p>When we observe nature and have the realization that everything we see and make
up this wonderful spectacle of perfection was the result of the project of a
divine eternity, we feel greatly recognized and infinitely small. The seas, the
land, the forests and all that surrounds us and satisfies the hunger of the
world with its fruits, grants us a lesson of unmatched bestowal. The life we
feel, in reality, seems to us a dream. A wonderful dream, whose flame we must
feed with the same color and purity that is offered to us by nature, and,
whenever possible, we strive to do everything we can so that this dream will
never become a nightmare of destruction of life on Earth or simply in &hellip;</p>

<p><em>The River&rsquo;s Dream</em></p>

<p>Born in a glorious blast of nature, a tiny stream of water was born on the
crest of an imposing hill. &ldquo;Alive,&rdquo; brilliant, gleaming colorful reflections on
sunny days, dazzled the little birds&rsquo; eyes that, in wonder, began to take water
and bath in the small source of life.</p>

<p><img src="/images/nascente.JPG" alt="nascente" /></p>

<p>Slowly descending the slope of the hill, the timid stream of water, like all of
us, traced its course to the unknown, dampening the earth and causing, as if by
magic, little green plants to sprout on its banks, which in a short time, were
transforming the landscape of their glorious path into a winding flowery path.
Time passed, and with it the floodwaters increased, transforming our little
flow into a vigorous brook which, with its continuous and restless brooding,
seemed to invite birds and animals into a harmonious relationship of life and
health.  Everything was perfect. The animals calmly drinking water along their
bed. The fish leaped with joy, out of the water, as if wanting also to observe
the wonder of the green, and the flowers coloring the fertilized and moistened
margins.  &ldquo;The next day&rdquo;, already discovered by man and now a practically
formed river, our old tiny stream of water laughed in foams among the stones,
exulting with joy at having become the spring, which freely and generously
makes the earth the cradle of all the living nature.</p>

<p><img src="/images/rio e espumas.jpg" alt="nascente" /></p>

<p>Marveling at the purity of the water he drank, the quantity of fish at his
disposal, the man began to live amicably with our river, paddling, fishing and
feeding the family with tasty fish of the most varied species with the most
varied designs and colors.  It was common to see the women of the small
villages washing the clothes on the banks of the rivers, hitting the stones,
and then with cans on their heads, going home, graciously taking all the water
they needed for all domestic uses.  The bright and sunny day was gradually
shifting to a dark gray. Dense clouds of dry, toxic smoke, emitted by large
industrial complexes, prevented the sun&rsquo;s rays from turning into the bright
colors our clear, tranquil river reflected.  In their inadvertent path through
small farms, small villages, factory and backyard grounds, the water was
being polluted by toxic products, pesticides, sewage sludge, cart hoops,
bottles and bottles of beer, soda, and other refuse. Pieces of plastics of used
packaging of all the colors, the colorful alive of the nature, in the sad
picture of the nefarious reality of the unforgiving action of the man.  At
the moment, it is considered that there is not a single river in the world that
is not transformed into a deposit of toxic substances. The fish trawled
contaminated to the banks of the rivers, dying with the gills exposed to the
sun, as if trying to find a way to warn the men to the great disaster that they
are imposing against nature.  When we observe the simple purity of nature, we
feel, in the smallest detail of its evolution, the image that &ldquo;God&rdquo; intended to
project for man to go to Earth, which &ldquo;He&rdquo; represents for the Universe.  I am
sure that it is still time for us to wake up and never allow all the disrespect
that nature has suffered to continue to be criminally repeated, and regretted,
to pretend that everything that has happened so far has been nothing but a sad
dream From River.</p>
