<p><em>“A project to the sustainable aiming for Arab Countries”</em></p>

<p>Considering the necessity of establishing the reorganization of a productive system in modern molds and within a focus of sustainability, it was developed by the ex-representative of the Estate Company EMBRAPA, Mr. Sady Ricardo dos Santos chairman of CEPEDA – (Research, Preservation and Environmental Development Center), the AGRO ECONOMICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM BY SATELLITE.</p>

<p>The program was computerized by  INPE, registered at CREA e CONFEA and considered by EMBRAPA, INPE, CREA, AGRICULTURE MINISTRY and other governmental agencies connected to agriculture and environment in Brazil, as a new model to economic, environmental and agro industrial activities, capable of promoting the recuperation of the international economies with a sustainable development. It will become possible to increase production and productivity, to make it compatible to the reduction of environmental pollution by the use of agro toxic and fertilizers and consequently improving quality of life.</p>

<p>The AGRO ECONOMICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM BY SATELLITE should be developed in a Management Center, with high technology, located in the most developed areas of the Arab Countries and with all technicians highly specialized , in all segments connected to the agro environmental system of the Arab Countries, and in conditions to interconnect on the net to all the agencies related to the agriculture, cattle end environment already in existence.</p>

<p>The CENTER that will work as an NASA, will count with the support of specialized technicians in the areas of agriculture, cattle,  forests, health, desert lands, coastlines, environment and etc., as a whole and including staff highly qualified in computer technology specialy focused on the work to elaborate the satellite information
All the areas of the Gulf Region will be tracked by Satellite, so that a true Territorial Inventory is elaborated through the crossing of information plans defined according to the characteristics and peculiarities of the areas of study, with the  Diagnosis of each region. Within an enclosing level, all gathered data will approach the following information plans: Climatic/meteorological, earthly environments, geomorphologic, farming, geologic, oceanographic ally parameters, aquatic environments, energetic, agrarian, social economic, among others.
All the areas that will be used to advantage with agricultural procedures, sandy or not, will be dimensioned, qualified and quantified. All the irrigation system from the sandy regions could be evaluated, in necessities and in volume of desalinated water as well as in evaluation of the possibilities for utilization of new regions.</p>

<p>A fundamental chore to be considered with an excellent importance of modern technology utilization, of orbital satellite use, managed by the CENTER, it was the construction of new underground water channels, helping in this way to stimulate the agriculture as a program of combat to desertification, and the arborization that transformed the region in one of the greenest cities of the Arabic Peninsula.</p>

<p>The city provided with great infrastructure: museums, universities, international airport, green lakes amongst the mountains, zoo, aquariums, amusement parks, camel racetrack, a variety of luxury hotels, resorts, golf fields, archaeological sites among others. The city is considered one of the greenest of the Arabia, due to its vegetation.</p>

<p>The program carries through a true dynamical regional x-ray that by the Information Geographical System used in the Graphic Stations and high-resolution computers in the Center, can evaluate, plan and manage all agro environmental complex according to the vocations and potential of each region.
In the specific action the program could classify the areas of study,  qualifying and quantifying all the possible ways to use the ground such as: vegetation, cultural areas, water resources, human nesting’s, cities, road mesh, railroads, natural and artificial forests, native and planted pastures, volume and quality of the aquatic environment, deserts and  etc.
This project has the goal of creating mechanisms so that administration of territories makes it possible to improve the quality of life of its population. For that, it is indispensable a real knowledge of the regions, considering its true potentialities and natural vocations, as well as the capacity to support the environment so that the human activities can be directed correctly.</p>

<h3 id="diagnosis">DIAGNOSIS</h3>

<p>Using modern technologies, by means of Work Stations (Work stations, SGI, Data Bank, CAD, etc.), distributed throughout the Gulf region, and with
the Monitoring Center located in the convergence center of the Arab Countries,  to survey information, through digital and visual processes of data interpretation, satellite images, (Geographic Systems, radar, etc), field tracking, research data, grounds, climate, cultures, cattle,
eonomic conditions of the population and other representative regional factors</p>

<p>The diagnosis will be done  in the  Graphic Stations of  the Center by crossing data  processing of satellite  images and information  according to the SGI (geografical Information Service) and the existence information about ground, climate and other representative regional factors, we will have in hands information plans that after being analyzed can furnish us the ways to planning and direct the activities agro, wild, shepherding, human nesting, agro industrial, water resources, biodiversity, forests, desert areas, oceanography, etc., in a spacial vision and local confirmation in the different worked areas.  In the function of the regional reality diagnosis, a mapping of the entire farming and environmental system, by regions and counties, will be effected.</p>

<p>In a SECOND MOMENT, after all the information plans are analyzed by the  diagnosis and the farming, and environmental is complete, it will be necessary to define which farming explorations and agro industrial, with the use of advanced technologies and of satellites in orbit in the diverse ecological environments in the selected areas. It will be  adjusted better to the different regions in function, therefore, its vocation and potentials of the different locations, that is, the places of the Arab Countries where different types of exploration will be really done, like wheat, rice, beans, corn, potato, flowers, forests and etc., the pasture areas in existence and other adequate to the development of cattle raising, milk farming, poultry keeping and others.
After that is complete, a survey of the kinds of consumed products by the population will be done, the capacity of production of the regions of study, as well as the necessities of consumption of each region involved in the Program. This kind of evaluation will be developed for all the regions of the Gulf area, keeping always in mind, and this is importance, the viability and necessity of agro business for this products to other countries, or even the exportation to other regions of interest. This kind of program is called: ORIENTATED  MARKET.</p>

<h3 id="orientated-market">ORIENTATED  MARKET</h3>

<p>The Implantation of the agro industry as well as its production could also be dully predicted due to the possibilities of regional consumption and exportation viabilities to a national and international level.
The AGRO ECONOMICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT CENTER BY SATELLITE will be installed in the Center of best access and political, economical and scientifically importance in the Region and placed in the net of computers of all Agencies connected  to the complex of Agencies in the areas of farming, economical, environmental and etc, in existence in the Arab Countries, in a way which all information, always updated, not only by the satellites but also by the regional priorities on the ground by the program, research and similar Agencies, as well as making possible, qualifying and quantifying the necessity of international priorities – .</p>

<p>Based on the regional diagnosis, the  Center will be able to identify the problems of environmental impact, and orientate the Controllers to the ordering the process of director plans development to the selected places. That will be the rational way to prevent problems os inadequate utilization of the environmental patrimony.</p>

<h3 id="sustainable-development">SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</h3>

<p>When the environment is analyzed, normally the attention involves pratically the forests and in a second moment to the ground, water resources, air, food, and etc. However, the problems of environmental changes (erosion, springs, ciliary bushes, forests devastation, forest fires, problems with ground poisoning, air, water and etc), reach the totality of the ecological patrimony in a global way.</p>

<p>There is a joint evaluation missing, integrating all human nestings, with researches inherent to the ecosystems, with data about climates, ground, cultures, cattle, forests, sea, deserted areas and etc.<br />
A special attention must be given to the areas  subject to low and high temperatures, frost, hail, floods, droughts or other actions of environmental impact, with pronounced influences about the environment and farming exploitations.</p>

<p>The non-observance of this factors by the administrators,  determines environmental degradation, with repercussions highly negative to all the production system, to the environment an quality of life.
With the regional development control of farming and environment, all situations that involve the problematic of production and environmental defense could, not only be dimensioned, but also managed in full sustainable exploitations, being the biodiversity protected and dully evaluated and explored in its real values and benefits to the humanity.
There will be adequate prevention and handling of all problematic of fires and droughts, and a control of Forest fires in farming areas and of pasture, so harmful to the complex of farming and environmental.
The human nesting’s will be controlled, managed, evaluated and protected.
All agricultural production and cattle of the Arab Countries could be duly planned not only in function of regional vocations and potentials, but also mainly face to the orientation of market, even in the same set of the deserted areas or even with a planning directed to the preservation of the natural resources and sea genetics.
With the implantation of a PROGRAM of this size, all complex of the regions and of the environment as a whole, could, for the first time, count on a system in conditions of planning and developing a new model of production and protection of the environment in a sustainable way. The entire Program will be managed by the CENTER in a continuous way and with a regularity of the satellites
round about the globe by means of the Geographic Information Systems of the Workstations.
All these actions propitiated by the program AGRO ECONOMICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, by satellite, can gradually transform the ARAB COUNTRIES in a powerful self-sustainable nation, with its people days of abundance and projecting a future with more health and consequently improving the quality of life of all noble Arabic population.</p>
